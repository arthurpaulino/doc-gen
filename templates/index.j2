<p>Navigate through mathlib files using the menu on the left.</p>

<p>Declaration names link to their locations in the mathlib or core Lean source.
Names inside code snippets link to their locations in this documentation.</p>

<p>
You can search through declaration names, modules names, and documentation strings,
and filter these results to include only certain kinds of declarations
or declarations with certain attributes.
The search prioritizes the declaration name first, documentation string second, and module name third.
</p>

<p>
Your first search may be slow, but subsequent searches should be faster.
If you plan to do many searches, we recommend keeping one tab open for searching
and opening results in new tabs.

<p>This documentation has been generated with mathlib commit
<a href="{{ mathlib_github_root }}/tree/{{ mathlib_commit }}">{{ mathlib_commit }}</a>
and Lean commit <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/{{ lean_commit }}/library">{{ lean_commit }}</a>.</p>

<p>Note: mathlib is still only partially documented, and this HTML display is still
under development. We welcome pull requests on <a
href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/doc-gen">GitHub</a> to update
misleading or badly formatted doc strings, or to add missing
documentation.</p>
